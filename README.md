# Windows-Boot-Manager-Fix
A guide and set of scripts to fix dual boot issues in Windows 11, specifically to resolve Chinese locale (zh-CN) to English locale (en-US) discrepancies in boot entries. This repo uses bcdedit to manage boot configurations, delete unnecessary entries, and set the system to boot directly into Windows 11 with English as the default language.
